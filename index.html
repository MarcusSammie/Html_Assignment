        <h3> why python?</h3>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Every year I consider whether to continue using Python o whether to move on to a different language-perhaps
            one that's newer to the programming world. But I continue to focus on Python for many reasons. python is an
            incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many languages would
            require. Python's syntax will also help you write "clean" code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to
            debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages </p>

        <p>People use Python for many purpose: to make games, build web appli-cations, solve business problem, and
            develop internal tools at all kinds of interesting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific
            fields for academic research and applied work</p>

    <center>
        <p>One of the most important reasons I continue to use Python is because of the Python community, which includes
            an incredibly diverse and welcom-ing group of people. Community is essential to programmers because pro-
            gramming isn't a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most experienced programmers, need to ask advice
            from others who have already solved similar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community is
            critical in helping you solve problems, and the Python community is fully supportive of people like you who
            are learning Python as your first pro-gramming language. python is a great language to learn, so let's get started.</p>
